[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A collection of Matlab functions for the Classical Lamination Theory
(ClT). The functions are part of a Master course on Composites at the
University of Twente.

For background information on the CLT, the reader is kindly invited to
